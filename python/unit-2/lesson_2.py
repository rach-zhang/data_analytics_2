1. What is Python and why is it useful?

Python is a general purpose, interpretive, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It is useful for data analytics because it can work with very large datasets, perform complex operations, and Python code can be saved and re-run.

2. Are the following variable names allowed in Python?

a. 1_message: Yes
b. Greeting_message: Yes
c. Message_1: Yes
d. First name: No
e. Full_name: Yes

3. Create a variable that holds the string "hello there!"

message = "hello there!"
print(message)

4. Create a variable for first name, last name, and an email extension. Concatenating all three together to form an email address.

first_name = "rachel"
last_name = "zhang"
email_extension = "@gmail.com"
email_address = first_name + last_name + email_extension
print(email_address)

5. Store someone you know name in a variable called name. Print their name in lower and uppercase using a method.
name = 'Henrietta'

print(name.lower())
print(name.upper())

6. Using a variable, ask your friend if they want to hang out on the 15th of the month.
